<h1>VIP Customer</h1>
Create a new class VipCustomer.
It should have 3 fields: name, credit limit, and email address.

Create 3 constructors.
* 1st constructor empty should call the constructor with 3 parameters with default values.
* 2nd constructor should pass on the 2 values it receives and add a default value for the 3rd.
* 3rd constructor should save all fields.

Create getters only for this using code generation of Intellij as setters won't be needed
Test and confirm it works.
