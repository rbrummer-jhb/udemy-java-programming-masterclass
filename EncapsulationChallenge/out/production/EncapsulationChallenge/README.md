# Encapsulation Challenge

Create a class and demonstrate proper **encapsulation** techniques.

The class will be called **Printer**.

It will simulate a real Computer Printer.

It should have fields for the **toner level**, **number of pages** printed,
and also **whether it's a duplex printer** (capable of print on both sides of 
the paper).

Add a method to **fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%)**, another 
method to
simulate printing a page (which should **increase the number of pages** 
printed).

Decide on the scope, whether to use **constructors**, and anything else you 
think is needed.
