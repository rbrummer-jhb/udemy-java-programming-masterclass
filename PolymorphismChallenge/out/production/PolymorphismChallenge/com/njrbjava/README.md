# Polymorphism Challenge

Going back to the Car analogy, Create a **base class** called **Car**.

It should have a few fields that would be appropriate for a generic car class.
**engine, cylinders, wheels, etc.**

Constructor should initialize **cylinders** (number of)  and **name**, and set
**wheels** to **4** and **engine** to **true**. Cylinders and names would be 
passed parameters.

Create appropriate **getters**.

Create some methods like **startEngine()**, **accelerate()**, and **brake()**.

Show a message for each in the base class.

Now create 3 sub classes for your favourite vehicles.

Override the appropriate methods to demonstrate polymorphism in use.

**Put all classes in the one java file (this one).**
